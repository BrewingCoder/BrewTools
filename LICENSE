Ideas were garnered from Extra Utilties and some of Rwtema's code was review on github but fully rewritten for the more modern versions of Minecraft.

This work in it's whole is released under the MIT License.   Basically do what you want, don't be a Dick about it.  I do this to learn Minecraft, 
have some cool crap to play with when I play with friends and my kids.  If you steal my work it's nothing but flattery to me :P
