BrewTools, a collection of odds and ends that the Brew Team has enjoyed over the years but can't quite seem to find in today's collection of available mods.

By default we use 256 pixel textures.  If there is enough interest outside of the Brew Team I'm totally open to creating 16 and/or 32 pixel textures and having those be options within the mod.

### Items of note, and origins:

* Redstone Clock - Just like the old Extra Utilities.  Cycles a redstone signal on and off.  Great for getting your tinker's smeltery to auto-pour ingots.  Throw a lever on it to control when it cycles. (or any redstone signal really -- if it gets a signal it stops cycling)

* **Abyssal and Quarried Stone.**  I *loved* these blocks back in the Railcraft days and often used these black/off-white blocks as primary building materials for bases, roads, etc.  I've added both with a heavy ore spawn and many variations including slabs, stairs, walls, cobbled, cracked, etc.

* **Mining Dimension.**  Yes I know there are a few out there. But I particularly miss Aroma1997's Mining World.  In heavy tech packs manual mining is trivial and most players quickly progress to some machine that automates the mining for them.  These machines have a tendency to destroy the world so having a nice, flat, always daytime dimension that can get chewed up by quarries, Builders, Miners, etc. is our preference.  That and we can totally reset it on a regular basis without destroying our lovely bases!
* **Night Vision Goggles** Because one should not have to be in the dark when playing tech packs.  These goggles give you night vision while worn however they significantly reduce your health while doing so.

---
TODOS:

* 1.18 Version.  I started with 1.16.5 because most of the mods I like are still back in that version.  As when this stabilizes 1.18 will  be next on the list
* Liquid  Barrels, like the old 256 bucket Extra Utilities  Barrel.  Maybe even require you to whack it with a stick like the original.
* Simply Mining Machines, various levels.  Similar to old-school simple miners these one block devices will take a solid fuel and mine some area around them from current level to bedrock. 

| Level                |  Area  | Cost Per |
|----------------------|:------:|---------:|
|Stone| 1 sq.  |      .25 |
|Iron| 3 sq. |       .5 |
|Gold| 5 sq. |      .75 |
 |Diamond|7 sq.| 1|
|Emerald|11 sq| 1.5|
|Netherrite|Full chunk|2|

*Make mining dimension fully configurable when it comes to ore spawning.  give 100% control to modpack creator in a JSON file.
